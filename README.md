The Note Taker is a simple application that allows users to create, save, and manage notes. It is designed to help users organize their thoughts or keep track of tasks that need to be completed. This project focuses on building the back end using Express.js, while the front end is provided. The application stores and retrieves notes from a JSON file, making it easy to manage the data. The final product is deployed on Render.
